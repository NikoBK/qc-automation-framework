# Quality Control Lab Automation Framework
This project aims to develop a suitable application framework for automation of quality control labs in general use.
The code presented in this repository is part of a bachelor project for six Robottechnology b.sc. Students at Aalborg University.

# Build & Run
**On Windows:**\
Open a project after starting Visual Studio and locate the `.csproj` file within the project directory.\

**On Linux:**\
After cloning the repo, just edit the `.cs` files with whatever editor, build with `dotnet build AutomationFramework.csproj` and run with `dotnet run` (you need to be in the project root dir to build and run the executable).

**NOTE**:\
The project runs on .NET Core 9, specifically (as of writing this) 9.0.102.\
If you do not have this version of .NET Core then your solution would be to update visual studio.

The dotnet sdk (linux) should be updated if you use arch.
